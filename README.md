# Octo Films

## Development Process

First of all, a prototype for Octo Films was created in Figma. You can view the design and user flow here:

[Figma Prototype â€“ Octo Films](https://www.figma.com/design/dPeA6lGy8tOHCLZoJPKRDv/Octo-Films?node-id=0-1&t=chQnjXG8pvWHCI9Y-1)

This prototype served as the foundation for the application's UI and user experience before development began.
Not all features from the prototype were implemented, but the core functionality remains intact.
