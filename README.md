This is Luciand Diaconu's repo. (S00000724)

### Live Demo
You can view the live demo of Octo Films at [Octo Films Live Demo](https://octo-films.lucio.website).


Octo Films is a React Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to rate films they have viewed. Users can browse a list of movies, add their own ratings, and keep track of their film-watching history in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features Overview

See [Features.md](./Features.md) for a detailed list of features, requirements, user roles, and main pages included in Octo Films.

### Import Movies from JSON

Admin users can import multiple movies from TMDB JSON files. 
This feature allows:
- Bulk import of movies from TMDB API responses
- Real-time progress tracking
- Error handling for invalid or duplicate entries
- Automatic mapping from TMDB format to backend Movie format

See [IMPORT_GUIDE.md](./IMPORT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on using this feature.

This feature was implemented to facilitate the addition of movies to the database, especially for the online demo version, where manually adding movies would be time-consuming.

## Development Process

First of all, a prototype for Octo Films was created in Figma. You can view the design and user flow here:

[Figma Prototype â€“ Octo Films](https://www.figma.com/design/dPeA6lGy8tOHCLZoJPKRDv/Octo-Films?node-id=0-1&t=chQnjXG8pvWHCI9Y-1)

This prototype served as the foundation for the application's UI and user experience before development began.
Not all features from the prototype were implemented, but the core functionality remains intact.

## API Definition
The API for Octo Films is defined in the [API.md](./API.md) file. It includes endpoints for:
